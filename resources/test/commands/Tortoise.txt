# eventually this file might contain some language tests that only
# work in Tortoise, not in JVM NetLogo.
#
# for now, its main purpose is as a place to temporarily add new
# language tests during development without having to depend on
# a new NetLogoHeadlessTests artifact.  if the test you add
# here should pass on JVM NetLogo too, then before committing
# and pushing, please add the test to the NetLogo repo instead.

  2 + 2 => 4

# these next two added to NetLogo repo in 25f9bd8 and 037aa4b
# so can be removed here once we've upgraded our NL dependency - ST 4/19/14
