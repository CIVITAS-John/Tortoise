# eventually this file might contain some language tests that only
# work in Tortoise, not in JVM NetLogo.
#
# for now, its main purpose is as a place to temporarily add new
# language tests during development without having to depend on
# a new NetLogoHeadlessTests artifact.  if the test you add
# here should pass on JVM NetLogo too, then before committing
# and pushing, please add the test to the NetLogo repo instead.
