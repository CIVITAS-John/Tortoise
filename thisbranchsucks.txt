Things that are lousy about this branch:

Highest:
-Failing test suites: TestModelDumps, TestTopologies, TestModels, TestAgents

High:
-CoffeeScript compiled in SBT
-Value wrappers: ID, NLColor, XCor, YCor, PenMode
-Englishify this junk!
-Fatten up those arrows!
-Abolish postfix control flow (e.g. `3 if true`)
-Loops on numerical ranges should be Lodasherized
-Apply type signature to all methods
-Kill "amount" and "a" and "t" as varnames
-I hate `array[..]`.  It clones, but cryptically
-Names of private members should be preceded with underscores
-Clean up import ordering and 'integration' vs. 'engine' nonsense

Mid:
-Lack of modularization (RequireJS)
-Agentsets don't handle dead agents correctly.  JVM NetLogo has `DeadSkippingIterator` for this.  Tortoise just continues to act as if the dead agents are valid, unless they're a part of a breed agentset.  Check out being able to observe object changes in ECAMScript 6.
-The way that I lumped patches in with breeds doesn't work correctly.  Namely, patches don't actually have breeds, so it just ends up being `undefined`, which isn't really right
-Engine variables should be referenced by name, rather than number

Low:
-`./sbt benchmark` does the same thing as `./sbt run`
-Lousy interfaces with SpiderMonkey and V8
