Things that are lousy about this branch:

High:
-CoffeeScript compiled in SBT
-Value wrappers: ID, NLColor, XCor, YCor, PenMode
-Englishify this junk!
-Fatten up those arrows!
-Abolish postfix control flow (e.g. `3 if true`)
-Loops on numerical ranges should be Lodasherized
-Apply type signature to all methods
-Kill "amount" and "a" and "t" as varnames
-I hate `array[..]`.  It clones, but cryptically
-Names of private members should be preceded with underscores
-Clean up import ordering and 'integration' vs. 'engine' nonsense
-"CC Uri" notices

Mid:
-Lack of modularization (RequireJS)
-Agentsets don't handle dead agents correctly.  JVM NetLogo has `DeadSkippingIterator` for this.  Tortoise just continues to act as if the dead agents are valid, unless they're a part of a breed agentset.  Check out being able to observe object changes in ECAMScript 6.
-The way that I lumped patches in with breeds doesn't work correctly.  Namely, patches don't actually have breeds, so it just ends up being `undefined`, which isn't really right
-Engine variables should be referenced by name, rather than number

Low:
-Random number generation often seems to take a lot of a model's time.  Would it be crazy to run the random generator within a web worker and constantly keep a pre-computed queue of 100 or 1000 or so numbers?
-`./sbt benchmark` does the same thing as `./sbt run`
-Lousy interfaces with SpiderMonkey and V8
