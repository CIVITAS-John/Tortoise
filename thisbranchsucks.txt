Things that are lousy about this branch:

Mid:
-Lack of modularization (RequireJS)
-Agentsets don't handle dead agents correctly.  JVM NetLogo has `DeadSkippingIterator` for this.  Tortoise just continues to act as if the dead agents are valid, unless they're a part of a breed agentset.  Check out being able to observe object changes in ECAMScript 6.
-The way that I lumped patches in with breeds doesn't work correctly.  Namely, patches don't actually have breeds, so it just ends up being `undefined`, which isn't really right
-Engine variables should be referenced by name, rather than number

Low:
-`./sbt benchmark` does the same thing as `./sbt run`
-Lousy interfaces with SpiderMonkey and V8
