Things that are lousy about this branch:

Very High:
-`Prims` vs. `AgentSet` nonsense sucks
-`Agents` should not be named as such, and should (hopefully) roll in with `AgentSet`
-Splats are slow.  But we pretty much always control whether or not we're passing in a variable number of arguments, so why not just pass in an array?

High:
-FPification
-`Shufflerator` is lame
-Replace `AgentModel` with an `Overlord` and overhaul the code
--Things should stop managing their own updates
-Polymorphism patrol and general abolition of `instanceof`
-Clean up import ordering and 'integration' vs. 'engine' nonsense and grab-bag of files in 'engine'
-"CC Uri" notices
-`Iterator` is puny and questionable in its existence, and its interface sucks
-Code in `Tasks` is confusing
-`_not` should not be wrapping everything in parens (move to `SimplePrims`)

Mid:
-Names of private members should be preceded with underscores
-Apply type signatures to all methods
--`Unit` functions should end in `return`
-Value wrappers: ID, NLColor, XCor, YCor, PenMode
-Agentsets don't handle dead agents correctly.  JVM NetLogo has `DeadSkippingIterator` for this.  Tortoise just continues to act as if the dead agents are valid, unless they're a part of a breed agentset.  Check out being able to observe object changes in ECAMScript 6.

Low:
-Optimizations
-Random number generation often seems to take a lot of a model's time.  Would it be crazy to run the random generator within a web worker and constantly keep a pre-computed queue of 100 or 1000 or so numbers?
-Lousy interfaces with SpiderMonkey and V8
